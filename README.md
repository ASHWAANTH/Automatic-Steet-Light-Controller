## INTRODUCTION:
### Problem Statement:
Streetlights are crucial for public safety and urban aesthetics. However, traditional street lighting systems
 often rely on manual switching or fixed timers, which can result in significant energy wastage. 
 Lights may remain ON during the daytime or OFF when needed in overcast or low-light conditions due to human
 error or improper timing.
Thus, there is a need for a system that can automatically control streetlights based on the ambient
 light conditions, ensuring that they are ON only when necessary.
 
### Why this project??
The proposed project aims to enhance the efficiency of street
 lighting by using an Automated Street Light Controller. This system leverages a Light Dependent Resistor
 (LDR) and a Relay Circuit to:
 
Automatically turn __ON__ streetlights when the surrounding light falls below a certain threshold
 (e.g., at dusk or during dark weather conditions).

Automatically turn __OFF__ streetlights when ambient light increases (e.g., at dawn or on bright days).

__Key Benefits:__
__Energy Conservation:__ Avoids unnecessary power consumption by ensuring lights are ON only when needed.

__Reduced Human Intervention:__ Eliminates the chances of human error involved in manual switching.

__Cost Efficiency:__ Reduces electricity bills and maintenance costs over time.

__Environmentally Friendly:__ Supports sustainability by minimizing energy wastage.
